## Howdy, fellow &lt;𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜/&gt;!  &nbsp; 🙋‍♂️ &nbsp; I'm Nick. 

I live by the mantra "_Be the change you want to see in the world._" (Mahatma Ghandi)

There's nothing "special" I can share here, as of yet. 
What I can say, for sure, is that I'm a **very** curious person. I enjoy digging deep and getting to understand how things really work, in as much detail as possible.

I aim to one day be an active contributor of one or more OSS projects that I like/use.

### Programming
Until recently, I was developing backend code in Elixir <img src="https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/elixir_logo_20px.png" title="Elixir" alt="Elixir"/> for [SumUp](https://github.com/sumup)\
... and learning some Phoenix, Erlang, a bit of Python (ETL with Airflow) along the way.


My previous focus / works were with:
 - <img src="https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/java_logo_20px.png" title="Java" alt="Java"/> (non-professionally)
 <!-- Java ![java_logo_20px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/java_logo_20px.png) -->

 - <img src="https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/kotlin_logo_16px.png" title="Kotlin" alt="Kotlin"/> (professionally, for a little) 
 <!-- Kotlin ![kotlin_logo_16px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/kotlin_logo_16px.png) -->

 - <img src="https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/c_logo_14_15px.png" title="C" alt="C"/> (non-professionally)
 <!-- C ![c_logo_14_15px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/blob/main/priv/logos/c_logo_14_15px.png) -->


I can read code fairly well in these three, but wouldn't consider myself fluent with developing in either of them.
