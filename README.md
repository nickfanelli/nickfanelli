## Howdy! 🙋‍♂️ I'm Nick. 

I don't have anything "special" to share here, as of yet. 
What I can say, for sure, is that I'm a **very** curious person. I enjoy digging deep and getting to understand how things really work, in as much detail as possible.

I aim to one day be an active contributor of one or more OSS projects that I like/use.

### Programming
Currently developing backend code in Elixir ![elixir_logo_20px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/assets/7491638/0d86685d-605a-42ad-88b4-f1712d41a499) for [SumUp](https://github.com/sumup)\
... and learning some Phoenix and Erlang along the way.


My previous focus / works were with:
 - Java (non-professionally) ![java_logo_20px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/assets/7491638/00585edb-b348-4cc1-8400-eaa2288fe1b9)

 - Kotlin (professionally, for a little) ![kotlin_logo_16px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/assets/7491638/d8b32196-c34f-4c0f-9a2c-b8e70305ae1d) 

 - C (non-professionally) ![c_logo_14_15px](https://github.com/nickfanelli/nickfanelli/assets/7491638/1ed16165-31cf-4a16-9b05-deb2b5ac6e1e)

I can read code fairly well in these three, but wouldn't consider myself fluent with developing in either of them.

### Languages
 - Fluently: Portuguese (🇧🇷), English (🇺🇸)
 - Advanced: Spanish (🇪🇸 / 🇦🇷)
 - Beginner: Italian (🇮🇹)
